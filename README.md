Learning Design Patterns in Ruby
================================

This repository is a summary of the design patterns found in "Design 
Patterns in Ruby" by Russ Olsen. Each file contains the whys and hows 
of its design pattern, including some example code to show what it 
can look like. If you just want to see a quick description and 
implementation of a particular pattern in Ruby, this repository is 
for you.  

Note: This does not include all 23 of the Gang of Four patterns, in 
part because Ruby implements some of them under the hood.
